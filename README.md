## Motivation
Around 1.3 billion tonnes of food produced globally is wasted each year.
In Scotland, 1.35 million tonnes of food and drink wastages was estimated in 2013.Likewise, 600,000 tonnes of food and drink wastage was produced in 2014 out of which 60% was classed as avoidable. Approximately 20% of Scotlandâ€™s carbon footprint is generated by food waste where, avoidable food wastage is accountable for 2.1% which is equivalent to 1.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Similarly, the financial cost for avoidable food waste is around Â£1.1 billion per year. Scotland has set a target to reduce the food wastage by 33% by 2025.
Save the scran as a project aims to aid the project by providing a way to reduce the food wastage. The app allows user to add food and information about the food such as expiry date into the virtual fridge by taking a picture. If the food is approaching expiry date, the user can choose to put the item onto community market where other users are able to view the item and message the user to arrange pickup. This way a food item can be shared amongst the community market which could reduce the avoidable food waste.
